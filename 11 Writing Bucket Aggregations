So with bucket aggregations, we're just creating a bucket or a group of documents.

Creates buckets of documents.
we're establishing a criterion
to categorize our documents based on the date field.
So in this case, the order date of our ecommerce data,
we're going to create a bucket for every day,
and then we're going to put all of our documents
in whatever day bucket they belong to.
So we're just bucketizing our data out.


SAMPLE: 
# bucket aggregation
GET ecommerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,  # simplify the output
    "aggs" : {
      "orders_per_day": {  # any name
        "date_histogram": {  # bucket agg
          "field": "order_date",
          "calendar_interval": "day"
       }
     }
   }
}
