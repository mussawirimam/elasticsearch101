steps of logstash

1. login on filebeat agent server where filbeat will be setup on the server which monitors the file that you have specified
2. on kibana, click on stack management and then ingest pipeline

    b. you can click on create and deploy 

3. login on the logstash server, 
    a. go to logstash log file directory
      you can monitor the logs if there are any errors or not and if the your code from kibana got successfulyy deployed using tail -f command on log file

4. go on the server where the filebeat server from step 1 which is monitoring the specified file
    the file that file beat is monitoring from step 1, generate the logs so that it can show up on the kibana discover page... (you can yank and paste a new line in file)
5. now you look at the changes that took place or not from the step 2
