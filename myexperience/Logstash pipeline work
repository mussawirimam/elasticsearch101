steps of logstash

1. filebeat agent will be setup on the server which monitors the file that you have specified
2. you create a logstash pipeline using the processors like gsub to remove and replace the lines with help of regex
  a. you can click on create and deploy 
3. on the logstash server, you can monitor the logs if there are any errors or if the your code from kibana got successfulyy deployed using tail -f command on log file
4. the file that file beat is monitoring from step 1, you generate the logs so that it can show up on the kibana discover page.
5. now you look at the changes that took place or not from the step 2 


### logstash is the first layer of modulating the data
### ingest pipeline is the second layer of manipulating the fields
