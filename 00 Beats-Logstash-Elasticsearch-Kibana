BEATS:
------
Lightweight Data Shippers
Collect and ship data from the source. There are Beats for just about any kind or source of data you wish to collect.

Built-In Modules
Pre-built configuration pipelines for well-known use cases.

Extensible with libbeat
Build your own Beat using the same foundation that all official Elastic Beats are
built from.

LOGSTASH:
---------
Input, parse, enrich, and output live data streams. Logstash is an optional component of the Elastic Stack that provides advanced data processing capabilities.
It is worth noting that Logstash is powerful even outside of the Elastic Stack as a capable data processing tool.

1) Input data from virtually any source.

2) Filter, parse, and enrich the data.

3) Output the processed data to virtually any destination.

ELASTICSEARCH:
--------------
Most data solutions only perform one part of the data pipeline. Not Elasticsearch.

Process
With Elasticsearch ingest pipelines, you can parse and enrich data as it comes into Elasticsearch.

Index
Elasticsearch's storage is fast, highly scalable, and fault tolerant.

Analyze
Elasticsearch can quickly search and aggregate data.

KIBANA:
-------
Discover
Search, filter, and view data stored in the attached Elasticsearch cluster.

Visualize
Craft informative visualizations from Elasticsearch data.

Dashboard
Combine visualizations and searches into a single pane of glass.

Time Series Visual Builder (TSVB)
Create purpose-built time series-based visualizations.

Machine Learning
Discover and visualize hidden insights and anomalies within Elasticsearch data.

And Much More
APM, uptime monitoring, SIEM, stack monitoring, and more are also possible with Kibana.

DevTools
for interacting with elasticsearch through console on kibana
