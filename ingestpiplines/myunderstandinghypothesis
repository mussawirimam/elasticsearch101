first thing is that you have to have a data/log
1st get the data example: 
in the message field you see that you need to break down the log: "xyz" from the message field

2nd you will create the pipeline to break the field and use the correct processors accordingly

3rd push the pipeline on the system

4th simulate your pipeline on the data

5th put the pipeline inside the index template settings 

6th rollover the index with the pipeline
